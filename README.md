# Visualization using GLSL (2015)

This is an part of my CPSC 691 Rendering course project. In this project, I visualized triagnle meshes from ICON dataset for climate model using GLSL. Here, I used my favourite Parula colormap (Credit: https://github.com/kbinani/colormap-shaders). I followed multipass concept to render the triangle meshes with edges.
