# Visualization using GLSL (2015)

This is a part of my CPSC 691 Rendering course project. In this project, I visualized the triangle meshe from ICON (Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic) dataset using GLSL. In order to visualize, I used my favourite Parula colormap (Credit: https://github.com/kbinani/colormap-shaders). I followed multipassing method to render triangle meshe with the edges.
