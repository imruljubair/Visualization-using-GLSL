# Visualization using GLSL (2015)

This is an extension of my CPSC 691 Rendering course project. In this project, I visualized triagnle meshes from ICON dataset for climate model using GLSL. Here, I used MATLAB-like colormap - Parula (Credit: https://github.com/kbinani/colormap-shaders). I followed multipass concept to render the triangle meshes with edges.
